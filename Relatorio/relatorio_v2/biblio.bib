abstract = {With the rapid development of various multimedia technologies, more and more multimedia data are generated and transmitted in the medical, also the internet allows for wide distribution of digital media data. It becomes much easier to edit, modify and duplicate digital information. Besides that, digital documents are also easy to copy and distribute, therefore it will be faced by many threats. It is a big security and privacy issue, it become necessary to find appropriate protection because of the significance, accuracy and sensitivity of the information, which may include some sensitive information which should not be accessed by or can only be partially exposed to the general users. Therefore, security and privacy has become an important. Another problem with digital document and video is that undetectable modifications can be made with very simple and widely available equipment, which put the digital material for evidential purposes under question. Cryptography considers one of the techniques which used to protect the important information. In this paper a three algorithm of multimedia encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature and description. The New Comparative Study between DES, 3DES and AES within Nine Factors achieving an efficiency, flexibility and security, which is a challenge of researchers.},

@book{Anderson2001,
abstract = {"Universal Serial Bus System Architecture, Second Edition, " based on the 2.0 version of the Universal Serial Bus specification, provides in-depth coverage and a detailed discussion of USB. It focuses on the USB protocol, signaling environment, and electrical specifications, along with the hardware/software interaction required to configure and access USB devices. Key topics include: Hot plug support (detection of low-, full-, and high-speed devices) Electrical signaling at the 1.5, 12, and 480Mb/s rates 2.0 hub operation (including split transaction support) 2.0 high-speed protocol (including high-bandwidth and ping transactions) High-speed transceiver test modes Suspend/resume operations Device descriptors Device requests (commands) USB transaction protocols (low-, full-, and high-speed) Bus-powered devices Self-powered devices Error detection and handling Device configuration Device classes This second edition has been updated to reflect the changes in the USB specification from the original 1.0 to the current 2.0. The USB 2.0 specification defines high-speed transactions operating at 480Mb/s that increase throughput by a factor of 40 over the older USB devices. New high-bandwidth, ping, and split transactions have also been added to further increase efficiency of the high-speed protocol. The USB 2.0 specification makes major improvements to USB, while maintaining backward compatibility with 1.0 and 1.1 USB devices. If you design or test hardware or software that involves USB, you wouldn't want to miss the important updates in this book. "Universal Serial Bus System Architecture, Second Edition, " is an essential, time-saving tool. The accompanying CD-ROM includes an 85-minute USB 2.0 overview video by Don Anderson, featuring an introduction to the basic concepts underlying USB 2.0 bus operation and protocol. Topics covered include terminology, design goals of USB, a review of low- and full-speed operation used by USB 1.0 and 1.1 systems and devices, an introduction to USB 2.0 high-speed transfers, and how USB 2.0 hubs use split transactions to provide backward compatibility to low- and full-speed devices. "The PC System Architecture Series" is a crisply written and comprehensive set of guides to the most important PC hardware standards. Each title is designed to illustrate the relationship between the software and hardware and explains thoroughly the architecture, features, and operations of systems built using one particular type of chip or hardware specification. 0201309750B04062001},

During the actual industrial production, sometimes we do not need the full functionality of UART, but simply integrate its core part. UART includes three kernel modules which are the baud rate generator, receiver and transmitter. The UART implemented with VHDL language can be integrated into the FPGA to achieve compact, stable and reliable data transmission. It's significant for the design of SOC. The simulation results with Quartus II are completely consistent with the UART protocol.},

abstract = {Cryptography plays a key role in ensuring the privacy and integrity of data and the security of computer networks. Introduction to Modern Cryptography provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of modern cryptography, with a focus on formal definitions, precise assumptions, and rigorous proofs. The authors introduce the core principles of modern cryptography, including the modern, computational approach to security that overcomes the limitations of perfect secrecy. An extensive treatment of private-key encryption and message authentication follows. The authors also illustrate design principles for block ciphers, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and present provably secure constructions of block ciphers from lower-level primitives. The second half of the book focuses on public-key cryptography, beginning with a self-contained introduction to the number theory needed to understand the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, El Gamal, and other cryptosystems. After exploring public-key encryption and digital signatures, the book concludes with a discussion of the random oracle model and its applications. Serving as a textbook, a reference, or for self-study, Introduction to Modern Cryptography presents the necessary tools to fully understand this fascinating subject.},

@book{Corbet2005,
abstract = {Device drivers literally drive everything you're interested in--disks, monitors, keyboards, modems--everything outside the computer chip and memory. And writing device drivers is one of the few areas of programming for the Linux operating system that calls for unique, Linux-specific knowledge. For years now, programmers have relied on the classic Linux Device Drivers from O'Reilly to master this critical subject. Now in its third edition, this bestselling guide provides all the information you'll need to write drivers for a wide range of devices.Over the years the book has helped countless programmers learn:how to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system how to develop and write software for new hardware under Linux the basics of Linux operation even if they are not expecting to write a driver The new edition of Linux Device Drivers is better than ever. The book covers all the significant changes to Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel, which simplifies many activities, and contains subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. Readers will find new chapters on important types of drivers not covered previously, such as consoles, USB drivers, and more.Best of all, you don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book. All you need is an understanding of the C programming language and some background in Unix system calls. And for maximum ease-of-use, the book uses full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware.Today Linux holds fast as the most rapidly growing segment of the computer market and continues to win over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas. With this increasing support, Linux is now absolutely mainstream, and viewed as a solid platform for embedded systems. If you're writing device drivers, you'll want this book. In fact, you'll wonder how drivers are ever written without it.},

@book{Stinson2005,
abstract = {{\{}Douglas R. Stinson's Cryptography: Theory and Practice is a mathematically intensive examination of cryptography, including ciphers, the Data Encryption Standard (DES), public key cryptography, one-way hash functions, and digital signatures. Stinson's explication of "zero-sum proofs"--a process by which one person lets another person know that he or she has a password without actually revealing any information--is especially good. If you are new to the math behind cryptography but want to tackle it, the author covers all of the required background to understand the real mathematics here. Cryptography includes extensive exercises with each chapter and makes an ideal introduction for any math-literate person willing to get acquainted with this material.{\}} {\{} The third edition of this best-selling text provides unparalleled coverage of the use of cryptographic protocols that establish the steps that must be taken before any type of secret transmission can be completed. The author shows readers how the various parties to the transaction establish their cryptographic identities or keys, covers many of the cryptographic tools used in network security, and discusses topics that include copyright protection techniques and public key infrastructure. Cryptography: Theory and Practice, Third Edition is an outstanding text for senior undergraduate and graduate courses but also a useful reference for professionals interested in network security and cryptographic protocols. {\}}},

abstract = {Free as in Freedom interweaves biographical snapshots of GNU project founder Richard Stallman with the political, social and economic history of the free software movement. It examines Stallman's unique personality and how that personality has been at turns a driving force and a drawback in terms of the movement's overall success.Free as in Freedom examines one man's 20-year attempt to codify and communicate the ethics of 1970s era "hacking" culture in such a way that later generations might easily share and build upon the knowledge of their computing forebears. The book documents Stallman's personal evolution from teenage misfit to prescient adult hacker to political leader and examines how that evolution has shaped the free software movement. Like Alan Greenspan in the financial sector, Richard Stallman has assumed the role of tribal elder within the hacking community, a community that bills itself as anarchic and averse to central leadership or authority. How did this paradox come about? Free as in Freedom provides an answer. It also looks at how the latest twists and turns in the software marketplace have diminished Stallman's leadership role in some areas while augmenting it in others.Finally, Free as in Freedom examines both Stallman and the free software movement from historical viewpoint. Will future generations see Stallman as a genius or crackpot? The answer to that question depends partly on which side of the free software debate the reader currently stands and partly upon the reader's own outlook for the future. 100 years from now, when terms such as "computer," "operating system" and perhaps even "software" itself seem hopelessly quaint, will Richard Stallman's particular vision of freedom still resonate, or will it have taken its place alongside other utopian concepts on the 'ash-heap of history?'},
